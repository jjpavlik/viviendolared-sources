# viviendolared-sources

This repo is meant to keep the sources of my tests under https://viviendolared.blogspot.com. You may find pretty much anything here from Perl or Bash scripts to some C source files. For more details about the content of each file, you may want to check the comments or the blog entry related to the file. Since I don't usually write more than 1 post per week I'll use year/month/day notation to sort the files, and will try to comment them accordingly xD.
